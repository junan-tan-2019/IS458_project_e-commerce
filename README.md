# IS458 Project

## Background
This school group project was completed during my time in IS458 Cloud Computing module in my year 4 semester 1. The main aim for this project is to show how our team utilised the AWS services for our application. All AWS services utilised by this project has been tear down or deleted. Feel free to look around our code, you can use it as a guide as well especially if you are planning to use DynamoDB in your application.
