# Store Service

## Introduction

This is a cart service that uses DynamoDB to store its content. You need to download DynamoDB version for it to work, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html. Just follow the instructions to start the DynamoDB (Make sure you write "-sharedDb" beside the startup command). After downloading the DynamoDB, remember to populate the database with the node JS application that I send to you (I will be preparing a bash script when I have the time), remember to ask from me if you have not receive it.


Before using this service, please remember to setup the python virtual environment. And install the required modules listed on **"requirements.txt"** with this command: **"pip install -r requirements.txt"**.
